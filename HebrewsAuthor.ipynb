    "Since the book of Hebrews is relatively short, one may use lines of these and other books that we know were written by Apostle Paul. Sometimes it is pretty straight forward knowing the author as some books start like: \"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ...\" or something similar. Then we would gather books written by Apostle Luke, with this we can train our model and feed it with \"Hebrews\" for prediction. Let's see what would be the results.\n",

    "In this second attempt I will use scikit-learn approach, but in the future I would use spaCy (https://spacy.io/) to close the truth gap, the bible version to be used need to be in actual language, as the American Standard Version or the World English Version (https://worldenglish.bible/), The later will be used. The King James version cannot be used, even it is the most popular, it is a form of old english and spaCy might not be optimized for it."
